Default will be the browser language

## Authentication
The user details are saved in the database. The passwords are hashed.

## Qookies
Qookies are used to save the shippment informations. Since those information only have a short lifetime
(either it's till they place the order or it's till they sign out)

## Sessions
Sessions are used for example to know if and which user is connected. The database connection was saved in a
session to avoid multiple connections and also the language was saved in one.

## AJAX
AJAX was used for example to filter the shopitems without a reload or to update the number of items in the cart (navigation)

## JQuery
JQuery got used for example to redirect a site depending on a click or a simple dialog popping up.

## Responsiveness
